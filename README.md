# Synesthetic-Playground

Synesthetic-Playground is a simple web application that includes set of 2D animations and movements prompted by their corresponding sounds. This application was built in JavaScript and implemented the Paper.js framework for the animations. Paper.js is an open source vector graphics framework that runs a top the HTML canvas. The sound functionality was done through Howler.js, an open source web audio library for JavaScript. The sounds used were obtained from https://github.com/jonobr1/Neuronal-Synchrony.git . Utilized the SweetAlert plugin at http://t4t5.github.io/sweetalert/ for JavaScript to replace traditional alerts. This application is a clone of http://patatap.com/ .
